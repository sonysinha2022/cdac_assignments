            One Piece is a Japanese shonen manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It was first published in July 1997 and it hasnâ€™t looked back since. One Piece became a fan-favorite manga series soon after its debut. Its market domination was so overwhelming that it affected the sales of other series. With its huge success, it became one of the Big Three in its community and also got an anime adaptation by Toei Animation. Its first episode premiered on 20 October 1999 on Fuji TV.

            One Piece follows the story of Monkey D. Luffy, the protagonist of the series. As a child, Luffy ate a devil fruit unintentionally and his body gained the properties of rubber, essentially turning him into a rubber man. Luffy sets sail and travels the Grand Line along with his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, with a dream to find the One Piece and become the King of the Pirates. In his journey, Luffy travels to unique destinations and meets various people, friends, and foes.

            One of the things that make One Piece the successful franchise it is today is its unique and diverse cast of characters. Eiichiro Oda took a very interesting approach while designing his characters. Each character in the series has their own unique personality, quirks, and goals, which considering its vast number of characters, is a feat of its own.

            One Piece's characters are from a variety of nations and backgrounds, and they each have their own unique objectives and morals, not to mention their peculiar quirks. It's interesting how a character's skills mirror their character's personality. For instance, Luffy is a carefree and simple-minded individual but can be very rigid and a force to be reckoned with once he sets his mind on something, which is reflected by his abilities as a rubber man, simple but powerful.

            Apart from Monkey D. Luffy, viewers can choose their favorites from a large and diverse cast of characters. One Piece fans have been fortunate with a wide cast of characters that they have related to on many different levels over the years because each character has a unique backstory and identity.
